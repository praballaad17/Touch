## Touch app (social media app) link: https://kingdomapps.herokuapp.com/ 

## ðŸ“£ Summary

This application (Touch) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Sass. I have built the following pages within this application: login, sign up, dashboard with cronological order feeds, new post. There are four different pages, some are public and some are private with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data, and that data is retrieved using a custom hook.
